## Less is More ToC

On github.com, anchor tags are automatically generated for headers, we can make an educated guess about what that generated name will be to avoid the need for an anchor tag (ex: ```<a name="revision-history"></a>```) by the header.

## Table of Contents
* [1.0 Revision History](#10-revision-history)
* [2.0 Section 2](#20-section-2)
  * [2.1 Section 2.1](#21-section-21)
  * [2.2 Some Really Cool Section](#22-some-really-cool-section)

## 1.0 Revision History

##### Version 0.0.1
* Added "less is more" ToC example
* Started Revision History

## 2.0 Section 2

More content.

### 2.1 Section 2.1

This is pretty cool!

### 2.2 Some Really Cool Section

Woohoo! Markdown!
