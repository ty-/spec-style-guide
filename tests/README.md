Testing
-------

This document should be able to output cleanly using gitprint.com and pandoc. Pandoc requires some additional packages.

In ubuntu make sure you install at minimum the following:

```
sudo apt-get install pandoc texlive-generic-recommended
```

This folder will provide scripts for running tests to generate pdfs and other formats from the Markdown.
